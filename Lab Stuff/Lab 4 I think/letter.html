        <p>Our art program offers a diverse range of courses, focusing on both traditional

            We'd appreciate more details on your specific interests within these areas,
            including any particular projects or research themes you're considering.

        <h3>Artistic Inspirations</h3>
        <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern
            art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Impressionism</dt>
            <dd>
                Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction
                of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
            </dd>

            <dt>Abstract Expressionism</dt>
            <dd>
                This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had
                a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pop Art</dt>
            <dd>
                A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular
                culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.
            </dd>
