        <p>Thank you for the freedom you’ve given me. With every ride, you’ve carried me through winding roads, open
            highways, and quiet sunsets. You’ve been my escape, my companion, and my teacher, showing me the beauty of
            the journey over the destination. You’ve taught me to embrace the wind, to feel the road beneath me, and to
            live in the moment. For that, I am
            forever grateful.</p>
